      <p>Marfa began as a railroad water stop in the early 1880s. The town was given the name "Marfa" (Russian for "Martha") when the wife of a railroad boss suggested it. Although some historians speculated that the name was inspired by a character in Fyodor Dostoevsky's work The Brothers Karamazov, Marfa was named after Marfa Strogoff, a character in Jules Verne's novel Michael Strogoff. During the 1920s, the town flourished rapidly. During World War II, the Marfa Army Air Field functioned as a training station for thousands of pilots, including American actor Robert Sterling, before closing in 1945. Many of the United States Army's chemical mortar battalions trained at the site. But the town of marfa is also known for its art that decorates the town.&nbsp;Marfa's environs are regarded as a cultural hotspot for contemporary artists and artisans. Donald Judd, a Minimalist artist, relocated to Marfa from New York in 1971. After a few years of renting summer cottages, he purchased two huge hangars and a few smaller structures and began to permanently display his art. While this began with his New York building, the structures in Marfa enabled him to install his works on a wider scale. He purchased the first of two ranches that would become his primary residences in 1976, continuing a lengthy love affair with the desert scenery that surrounded Marfa. Judd then acquired decommissioned Fort D.A. Russell with the help of the Dia Art Foundation in New York, and began renovating the fort's buildings into art.&nbsp;In 1979, there were art spaces. As a type of antimuseum, Judd's idea was to house enormous collections of individual artists' work on permanent display. Judd argued that the current museum paradigm, in which art is displayed for limited periods of time, did not allow the viewer to fully comprehend the artist or their work as intended. </p>
